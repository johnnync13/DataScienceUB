        "> In general **Learning from Data** is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to infer (from data) a  model that allows *compact representation* (unsupervised learning) and/or *good generalization* (supervised learning).\n",

        "This is an important technology because it enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. \n",

        "Most of these algorithms are based on the *iterative solution* of a mathematical problem that involves data and model. If there was an analytical solution to the problem, this should be the adopted one, but this is not the case for most of the cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the most common strategy for **learning from data** is based on solving a system of equations as a way to find a series of parameters of the model that minimizes a mathematical problem. This is called **optimization**.\n",

        "\n",
        "The most simple thing we can try to minimize a function $f(x)$ would be to sample two points relatively near each other, and just repeatedly take a step down away from the largest value. This simple algorithm has a severe limitation: it can't get closer to the true minima than the step size.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The Nelder-Mead method dynamically adjusts the step size based off the loss of the new point. If the new point is better than any previously seen value, it **expands** the step size to accelerate towards the bottom. Likewise if the new point is worse it **contracts** the step size to converge around the minima. The usual settings are to half the step size when contracting and double the step size when expanding. \n",
        "\n",
        "This method can be easily extended into higher dimensional examples, all that's required is taking one more point than there are dimensions. Then, the simplest approach is to replace the worst point with a point reflected through the centroid of the remaining n points. If this point is better than the best current point, then we can try stretching exponentially out along this line. On the other hand, if this new point isn't much better than the previous value, then we are stepping across a valley, so we shrink the step towards a better point.\n",
